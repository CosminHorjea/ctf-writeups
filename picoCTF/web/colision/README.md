# It is my Birthday

It's kind of shitty, i got the files from the web, looked through various writeups, none work;

The filetype in Ubuntu for a pdf is image/pdf but the site checks for application/pdf

When i tried the same things, with the same files, on Windows it worked

Can you change filetype in Ubuntu?
